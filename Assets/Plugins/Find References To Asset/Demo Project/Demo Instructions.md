DEMO INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------
This Demo Project contains a variety of textures, materials, shaders, audio clips, prefabs, scripts, scriptable objects, and scenes, all within a hierarchy of folders with complex references to each other to simulate a real project's asset dependencies. 

You can test out the Find References To Asset tool in this project.

Open the tool from:
	Menu->Tools->Find References To Asset
	or use the hotkey Ctrl/Cmd + E

Go ahead, try searching for assets and see how easily you can now find where they are used!
